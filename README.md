Design a fully-connected Neural Network for digit recognition task
by Thinh Nguyen

A function to design and implement fully-connected neural network for multi-class classification.
Coded from scratch for learning purposes, no deep-learning framework used
User-specified number of hidden layers and number of neurons per layers.
Sigmoid function as neuron activation function. 
k-fold cross-validation, performance evaluated by: precision, recall, F-score

Run "NN_demonstration_digiClassification.m" for an example
